# on fatherhood

when my son was born, it fundamentally changed my perspective on life. i wanted to write about the experience, but ... went on living my life, changing diapers, etc. fast foward three years, and my wife and i welcomed a second son into our lives, so now i have twice the incentive to document my thoughts. of course, parenthood is a topic that has been beaten to death already (turns out humans have been making babies for quite some time), so i won't claim any novelty here, i'm mostly writing this for myself.

this post will be somewhat of a smorgasbord of things i found surprising or interesting about the journey into parenthood. also, i should say up front that despite me singing praise of parenthood here, this is not a post trying to convince others of having children -- it's a personal choice, it's not for everyone, and that should be respected.

## before birth
the period right after finding out that my wife was pregnant with our first son was surprisingly introspective. the two of us talked a lot about our own upbringings and our respective parents' parenting styles. we had talked about these things many times throughout our relationship, but the prospect of becoming a parent in the near future made these discussions less abstract and quite insightful.

## the overview effect
the [overview effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect) is a cognitive shift that many astronauts have reported experiencing after seeing the earth from space for the first time. of course, i've never been to space (hurry up, elon!), but from reading the accounts, i feel that there's some similarity between what they describe and what i felt holding my firstborn son for the first time. for a moment, i felt not as an individual, but as a thread in the fabric of human history, a part of something bigger than myself, despite having no religious inclinations whatsoever. it became apparent how spontaneous, and mysterious life was. i'll never forget that moment.

## priorities
it's obnoxiously cliche to say this, but having children makes you re-evaluate your priorities in life. i had heard this a million times, so maybe it was a self-fulfilling prophecy, but it was the sort of thing thing that, despite knowing that it's coming, still ends up feeling like the rug has been pulled from under your feet. the things that i had cared about and prioritized in my life, the things i had wanted to achieve... did they actually matter? and if so, why? different people have different types (and amounts?) of ambition, but i think at the root of it is a yearning for some sort fulfillment, and it's hard to think of something as fulfilling as raising a child.

## the future
do i really care about what happens in, say, 70 years? chances are i won't be alive then. i'd like to think that even before having children, my answer was "yes", out of sheer empathy for all the other human beings on this planet. but the incentive to care about the more distant future becomes a lot more visceral when you start to picture your kids growing up.

## feeling like a parent
i was surprised by how long it took for me to actually start feeling like a parent. when you hear the term "parenting", you think of things like reading books to you kid, teaching them things, building things out of legos with them, disciplining them, etc. but none of that happens in the first few months. the first few months feel a lot more like caregiving than parenting.

now that we have our second, i still have a similar feeling -- while i do feel like a parent because of the older child, i still don't feel like a family of four... the baby is still this adorable but abstract creature that have to take care of, not quite a person who is a part of the family yet.

## falling in love
i'm not a hopeless romantic type, so ive never "believed in" love at first sight. but that's the case for romantic love -- children are pretty weird in this regard. first off, even before the baby is born, you begin to have feelings for them (which is part of the reason miscarriage is so devastating to expecting parents). when the baby is born, i definitely felt a sort of love, but a really strange one... how could you love someone you just met? how could you love someone whom you don't even know? and not just that -- they are unknowable! they are just a little glob that sleeps and poops and has few other characteristics!

## advice
it's really difficult to study parenting in a scientific fashion, largely because doing a randomized control trial is virtually impossible. this opens the door to a lot of psuedoscience and a borderline religious belief systems of what "good" parenting is. whether it's about how to feed your children, or how to discipline them, or how to sleep train them (or whether to sleep train them), opinions vastly contradicting and people believe in their chosen methodology to the point of thinking you will literally ruin your child's life if you don't do XYZ. it's exhausting.

## parenting thesis
before my first son was born, a sort of parenting "thesis" popped into my head. now, as i've mentioned, the first few months didn't actually feel like parenting at all, so this didn't apply till much later, but after 3 years, i feel like this has aged well. the short of is, what are the things i'd most like my child to learn?

1. empathy: because i think this is a foundation for healthy relationships, and relationships are key to thriving.
2. curiosity
i feel like almost everything positive i've "achieved" in my life (by whatever metric) has been due purely to my curiosity. and the great thing is that kids are born curious. if you can just keep that fire going, they'll have intrinsic motivation to learn new things.
3. humor
because everyone has dark moments in their life, and humor is

## having a second

my wife and had hoped to have 2 kids at the outset. but i must admit, after we had our first, the decision for having a second was not as easy as i had expected. the idea that i wouldn't be able to give 100% of my attention to my son and that i'd have to split it between him and another child (that didn't even exist yet)
* on having a second
** more physically exhausting, less psychologically exhausting
** less of a trip
** enjoying the baby more -- less anxiety, more confidence, and also our last opportunity to enjoy a baby (since we only plan on having two).
