  <h1>about</h1>
  i'm a machine learning / computer vision engineer.  i received a PhD from UCSD where I was advised by <a href="https://vision.cornell.edu/se3/people/serge-belongie/">serge belongie</a>.  most of my graduate work was funded by an NSF IGERT traineeship and a <a href="https://research.google.com/research-outreach.html#/research-outreach/graduate-fellowship-award-recipients">2010 google fellowship</a>, and revolved around weakly supervised learning and its applications to object detection, recognition and tracking; one of <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/tracking/doc/tracker_algorithms.html#id2">my algorithms is included in OpenCV 3.0</a>.  after finishing my PhD, I started a company called anchovi labs which was <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/11/19/the-dropbox-computer-vision-acquisition-that-slipped-under-the-radar/">acquired by dropbox</a>; i worked at dropbox for 2.5 years.  i spent the next 3 years at <a href="https://www.orbitalinsight.com">orbital insight</a>, where i developed computer vision algorithms to analyze satellite imagery.  i currently work on medical imaging applications at <a href="https://health.google/health-research/">google</a>. oh, and if you haven't noticed already, i have no respect for capital letters.</br></br>

  in my spare time i play guitar, read/watch sci-fi, and occasionally blog/tweet.<br/></br>
